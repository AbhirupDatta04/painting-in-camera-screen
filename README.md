<n>Live on-screen tracking and painting using different colours acting as a canvas.</n>

---


## The aim of this project is to take into consideration the camera and track the movements to create our desired raw drawing/image on the paint canvas.

At first,we defined the upper and lower boundaries for blue colour and separate deques were added which consisted colours:Blue,Green,Red and Yellow.
To facilitate the icons or tools needed for paint it was needed to set up the painting interface and then Live video capture was made available,thereby grabbing the current paintwindow
Next step was to check whether the required pixels fall in the boundaries and subseqently contour finding for the image was done.
